                narrowed down to autonomous flying taxis, we planned out our overall design process into three main flexible
                sections: discover, design, deliver. Within each step, we iterated our approach to maximize our user-centered

                over 50 user tests on prototypes, and create 6 user insight driven iterations.</p>

          <h4 class="section-header">Week 9</h4>

          <h5 class="content-header">Challenge</h5>
          <p class="content-text">With recent technological breakthroughs in machine learning and AI, autonomous vehicles are coming closer to the
            reach of mass consumer markets. With new technologies brings new interactions, along with user interface and
            user experience issues that will make or break their future. Map out the experiences that will be required to
            assist people in interacting with autonomous vehicles in future cities.</p>
          <h5 class="content-header">Approach</h5>
          <p class="content-text">With an open prompt, my team first ideated and researched possible opportunity areas to focus in on. Once we narrowed
            down to autonomous flying taxis, we planned out our overall design process into three main flexible sections:
            discover, design, deliver. Within each step, we iterated our approach to maximize our user-centered process.
          </p>
          <p class="content-text">In the end, we used over 20 design research, prototyping, and testing methods (and even created some of our own
            through iteration on existing ones). This enabled us to reach over 500 users through our research, perform over
            50 user tests on prototypes, and create 6 user insight driven iterations.</p>
          <h5 class="content-header">Outcome</h5>
          <p class="content-text">As a result of 6 tested iterations at varying fidelity, in our final round of user testing, users were able to
            successfully accomplish booking & wayfinding to an autonomous vehicle and all mentioned that the experience was
            intuitive or easy. We were able to innovate multi-modal trip booking and add a new immersive compass based navigation
